					<p>Import & Export Code is to be obtained by the business entity for import into or export from India. Import & Export Code is popularly known as the IEC number. Import & Export Code is a ten-digit unique number issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT).<br><br>

IEC registration certificate is mandatory for a business involved in import and export. Hence, before initiating an import of goods into India, an importer must ensure that the importing entity has GST registration and IE code, both of which are required to clear customs.<br><br>

If an importer does not have both GST and IEC Code Registration, the goods will be stuck at the port and start incurring demurrage charges or could be destroyed.</p>
