					<p>Halal Certification is predominantly obtained for food and food-related products, and it is essential in Islamic countries. The term "Halal" is derived from the Quran, which means "permitted" or "lawful." Therefore, according to Islamic law, the Shariah, the Certification is used for Food and other consumables permissible for consumption. Halal Certification emphasizes cleanliness in all aspects of a person's life, and Halal foods ensure that the Food consumed by individuals is clean, hygienic, and does not harm their health or well-being. The Certification guarantees that the food product is safe for consumption. With the increasing awareness of Halal foods, more businesses are seeking Halal Certification for their products, restaurants, premises, etc.</p>

Typically, restaurants, hotels, slaughterhouses, and packaging and labeling materials seek Halal Certification to ensure they meet the requirements of Muslim consumers. However, Halal Certification is not limited to food production alone. Other products, such as non-alcoholic beverages, raw materials for food processing, pharmaceutical and healthcare products, traditional herbal products, cosmetics, personal care products, cleaning products, and everyday consumer goods, can also obtain Halal Certification.</span></li>
